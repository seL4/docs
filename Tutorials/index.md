# Overview

We have developed a series of tutorials to introduce seL4 and developing systems on seL4.

## List of tutorials
The tutorials are split into a number of broad categories, and have been designed around developer needs.

- The [seL4 tutorials](setting-up.md) are for people keen to learn about the base mechanisms provided by the seL4 kernel. The kernel API is explained with short exercises that show basic examples.

- [MCS](mcs) introduces seL4 Mixed-Criticality System extensions, which are detailed in this [paper](https://trustworthy.systems/publications/full_text/Lyons_MAH_18.pdf) and [PhD](https://github.com/pingerino/phd/blob/master/phd.pdf).

- [Libraries](libraries-1) provides walkthroughs and exercises for using the libraries provided in `seL4_libs`, which were developed for rapidly prototyping systems on seL4.

- [CAmkES](hello-camkes-0) generates the glue code for interacting with seL4 and is designed for building high-assurance, static systems. These tutorials demonstrate how to configure static systems through components.

- [Microkit](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/microkit/tutorial/) enables system designers to create static software systems based on the seL4 microkernel. We recommend this as a potential introduction to seL4, bearing in mind that the Microkit hides many of the seL4 mechanisms - it is designed that way, to make building on top of seL4 easier.

- [Rust](https://github.com/seL4/rust-sel4) allows people to write safer user-level code on top of seL4 without needing full formal verification, with a language that is receiving increasing interest and that aligns extremely well with security and safety critical embedded systems programming.

**Recommended reading**

Note that all of these tutorials require C programming
experience and some understanding of operating systems and computer
architecture.  Suggested resources for these include:

- C programming language
	- [C tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html)
- Operating Systems:
	- [Modern Operating Systems (book)](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/013359162X)
	- [COMP3231 at UNSW](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3231)

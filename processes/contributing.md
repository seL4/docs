# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the seL4 project sources. For contributions to this documentation site,
please see [our docs contribution guidelines](/DocsContributing).

## Conventions

Please read and abide by the following conventions when contributing:

- [Style Guide](/StyleGuide)
- [Git Conventions](/GitConventions)
- [Code of Conduct](/Conduct)
- [Pull requests](/CodeReview)

## Large contributions

If you would like to make significant changes to the seL4 kernel, or any of its libraries, consider making an [RFC](rfc-process). This will allow seL4 developers and the wider community to comment and approve of your design.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The seL4 Foundation uses the same sign-off process as the Linux kernel. For
every commit, use

    git commit -s

to add a sign-off line to your commit message, which should come out as:

    Signed-off-by: name <email>

By adding this line, you make the declaration that you have the right to make
this contribution under the open source license the files use that you changed
or contributed.

The full text of the declaration is at <https://developercertificate.org>.

The relevant github repositories are configured to only accept pull requests
where all commits are signed off. There are no other signatures or legal
documents required.

Some tips on using signed-off-by with git:

  - signed-off-by is different from signing commits with a GPG key (commit -S)
  - you can use `git commit --amend -s` to sign off a single existing commit if you’ve forgotten
  - you can use `git rebase --signoff <base-branch> `for signing off multiple commits on a whole branch
  - the DCO allows you to sign off commits for others -- see <https://developercertificate.org> for details
  - you can add an alias for sign-off to your git config, so you don’t have to think about it. For instance:

            git config alias.ci “commit -s"

    now `git ci` will commit with sign-off. The config command above is local
    for the current repository.

## Review and Testing Process

<img src="contributing.png" alt="Pull requests undergo code review before being accepted" />

The diagram illustrates the pull request review and testing process. For most
of the repositories on <https://github.com/seL4> and
<https://github.com/seL4proj>, additional tests, quality checks, and where
applicable the formal proofs can be run by people with at least the [Reviewer][]
role at the seL4 Foundation. Anyone can help review pull requests.

See also the pages on [Pull Requests](code-review) and [Suggested
Projects](/SuggestedProjects) for suggestions on where to contribute.

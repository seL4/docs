# Roles

The [seL4 Foundation][1] defines the following roles for seL4 development.

Apart from Contributor, which anyone can be, you can become a member of any of
these roles by decision (vote) of the [Technical Steering Committee][2] (TSC).
You can nominate someone for a role by emailing the chair of the TSC.

- **Contributor**:
    Anyone who contributes code, documentation, issues, etc via pull requests
    or otherwise.

- **Reviewer**:
    People with technical experience and interest to approve reviews on
    pull requests, be assigned and maintain issues, but without full
    commit rights.  They would typically be active Contributors already,
    but exceptions are possible. They become members of the seL4 GitHub
    org.

    The role does not confer membership or voting rights in the TSC.

   Current members are:

  - Christopher Guikema, Dornerworks
  - Axel Heider, Hensoldt Cyber
  - Jesse Millwood, Dornerworks
  - Yanyan Shen, Cog Systems
  - Benno Leslie, Breakaway Consulting

  &nbsp;

- **Committer**:
    People with direct write/push access to the repositories in the
    seL4 GitHub org. These are the people that can merge pull requests.

    The role does not automatically confer membership or voting rights
    in the TSC.

    Current members are the members of the Committers team on the seL4 GitHub
    organisation. These include the TSC members and the kernel engineers as well
    as the verification engineers of the Trustworthy Systems group.

- **SysAdmin**
    People with admin access to the seL4 GitHub org and repositories
    for purely administrative purposes, e.g. maintenance of CI
    infrastructure and repo membership/access control.

    The role does not confer membership or voting rights in the TSC.

   Current members are:

  - Peter Chubb, CSIRO's Data61
  - Luke Mondy, CSIRO's Data61

  &nbsp;

- **TSC member**:
    a member of the [Technical Steering Committee][2] of the seL4
    Foundation. This is the body that decides on the technical direction
    of the project, sets processes, guidelines, etc. Meetings of the TSC
    are public and will be announced on the seL4 developer mailing list.

   See [the TSC page][2] for current members.

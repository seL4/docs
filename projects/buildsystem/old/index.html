<h3 id="build-configuration">Build configuration</h3>
<p>Prior to building a project you need to
specify a configuration (settings, components, etc.) that you want to
build. Kconfig is a tool for simplifying and automating this process. In
a seL4 project you can enter make menuconfig in the top level directory
to be presented with a terminal menu for choosing which components to
build. Note that you will need the package libncurses5-dev installed to
display terminal menus. It is possible to select a configuration without
using the terminal menus, but techniques for doing this are not
discussed on this page.</p>

<p><img style="width:600" src="menuconfig.png" alt="The menu config interface" /></p>

<p>Use arrow keys and Enter to navigate the menu, Space bar to
select/deselect items and Esc-Esc to return to the parent level in the
menu hierarchy. On exiting the menu system you will be asked whether you
wish to save your configuration. If you choose to do so it will be
written to the file .config in the top level directory.</p>

<p>Many projects will have a default list of configurations for building
common scenarios. These are located in the configs/ directory. You can
load one of these by running make config_file where config_file is the
filename of the configuration you want to load. Whenever you load one of
these pre-made configurations it is usually wise to run make
silentoldconfig. This scans your project for configuration settings that
have changed since the pre-made configuration was created and updates
the configuration with the defaults of these changed settings. This is
not always what you want, but it generally works.</p>

<p>Your current configuration is stored in the file .config. This file
looks like a Makefile fragment and that is actually exactly how it is
used by build system when it comes time to build your project. One
gotcha to be aware of is that the comments in this file aren’t
completely comments, which you will find out if you try to edit them.
Kconfig parses these comments and will throw all manner of strange
errors if it thinks one is malformed.</p>

<p>Pre-made configurations are stored in configs/. To make a new
configuration, pick the settings you want in the menus then copy your
.config to configs/. Note that all the configurations in this directory
must end in _defconfig for the build system to identify them correctly.</p>

<p>The other file(s) you will want to care about is Kconfig. These files
tell Kconfig how to construct the menu hierarchy. A formal description
of the Kconfig options and syntax can be found at
<a href="http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt">http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt</a>.
Symbols are defined by using the ‘config’ statement. These symbols are
given the prefix ‘CONFIG_’ when the configuration is written to the
.config file.</p>

<h4 id="config">.config</h4>
<p><strong>.config</strong> is autogenerated by running
make some_default_config or make menuconfig. In general, you shouldn’t
modify this file manually, but the syntax is pretty obvious if you want
to. As noted below, it is not recommended to touch the comments in this
file. They are parsed by the build system and “malformed” comments can
cause strange and mysterious errors.</p>

<h4 id="appskbuild">apps/Kbuild</h4>
<p><strong>apps/Kbuild</strong> needs to fill the
apps-y variable with the targets of the applications to be built. To do
this you can reference the CONFIG_-prefixed variables from Kconfig. A
typical apps/Kbuild will look something like the following:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">apps-$(CONFIG_MY_APP)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> myapp

<span class="nl">hello</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">libfoo</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If your application has more complicated dependencies,
for example if it depends on libbar only when the
MYAPP_EXTRA_FUNCTIONALITY variable is selected, you can use the
following pattern:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">apps-$(CONFIG_MY_APP)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> myapp

<span class="nv">hello-y</span> <span class="o">=</span> libfoo
<span class="nv">hello-$(CONFIG_MYAPP_EXTRA_FUNCTIONALITY)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> libbar
<span class="nl">hello</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">$(hello-y)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="kconfig">Kconfig</h4>
<p>The Kconfig files (<strong>Kconfig,
apps/Kconfig, apps/myapp/Kconfig, libs/Kconfig, libs/libfoo/Kconfig,
tools/common/Kconfig</strong>) describe the structure of the menu you are
presented with when you type make menuconfig. The syntax of these files
is described at
<a href="http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt">http://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt</a> and
they are broken up in the obvious way; that is, apps/Kconfig contains
settings common to all applications in your project, libs/libfoo/Kconfig
contains settings specific to libfoo, … The Kconfig files together
determine the build configuration process that is described in more
detail below.</p>

<h4 id="appsmyappmakefile">apps/myapp/Makefile</h4>

<p>Your application Makefile,
<strong>apps/myapp/Makefile</strong>, should populate a set of variables and then
include common.mk. It will typically look something like the following:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">TARGETS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>notdir <span class="p">$(</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">))</span>.bin

<span class="nv">CFILES</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>patsubst <span class="p">$(</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">)</span>/%,%,<span class="p">$(</span>wildcard <span class="p">$(</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">)</span>/src/<span class="k">*</span>.c<span class="p">))</span> 
<span class="nv">ASMFILES</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>patsubst <span class="p">$(</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">)</span>/%,%,<span class="p">$(</span>wildcard <span class="p">$(</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">)</span>/crt/arch-<span class="p">$(</span>ARCH<span class="p">)</span>/crt0.S<span class="p">))</span>

<span class="nv">LIBS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> sel4c sel4 sel4rootserver sel4platsupport

<span class="k">include</span><span class="sx"> $(SEL4_COMMON)/common.mk</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>TARGETS should contain the list
of output files that this application needs built. CFILES and ASMFILES
list the C and assembly sources of your application, respectively. LIBS
lists the libraries this application will be linked against (without
their “lib” prefix). You can also use your Makefile to modify the flags
that are passed to the compiler or the linker when building your
application. To do this, modify the variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS,
respectively. For example, you can use “LDFLAGS += -T
path/to/linker.lds” to use a custom linker script for your application
or “CFLAGS := $(filter-out -Wall,$(CFLAGS))” to turn off compiler
warnings for your application. Note that these modifications should be
added <strong>after</strong> including common.mk.</p>

<h4 id="libskbuild">libs/Kbuild</h4>
<p>Like apps/Kbuild describes top-level
application dependencies, <strong>libs/Kbuild</strong> describes top-level library
dependencies. Similarly, it fills the variable libs-y with the libraries
to be built. A typical libs/Kbuild would look like:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">libs-$(CONFIG_LIB_FOO)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> libfoo 
<span class="nv">libs-$(CONFIG_LIB_BAR)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> libbar

<span class="nl">libfoo</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">common </span>
<span class="nl">libbar</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">common libfoo</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="libslibfoomakefile">libs/libfoo/Makefile</h4>
<p>The Makefile for a particular
library, <strong>libs/libfoo/Makefile</strong>, should just contain some variable
configuration and then include common.mk. Note that by using generic
environment variables you can often use the following template with no
modification for your library:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Library archive(s) that will be built. 
</span><span class="nv">TARGETS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>notdir <span class="p">${</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">})</span>.a

<span class="c"># Source files required to build the target. 
</span><span class="nv">CFILES</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>patsubst <span class="p">$(</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">)</span>/%,%,<span class="p">$(</span>wildcard <span class="p">${</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">}</span>/src/<span class="k">*</span>.c<span class="p">))</span>
<span class="nv">ASMFILES</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>patsubst <span class="p">$(</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">)</span>/%,%,<span class="p">$(</span>wildcard <span class="p">${</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">}</span>/src/<span class="k">*</span>.S<span class="p">))</span>

<span class="c"># Header files/directories this library provides. 
</span><span class="nv">HDRFILES</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>wildcard <span class="p">${</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">}</span>/include/<span class="k">*</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">include</span><span class="sx"> $(SEL4_COMMON)/common.mk</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can modify the compiler or linker flags applied when building your
library by modifying the NK_CFLAGS or NK_LDFLAGS variable
respectively. The process for doing this is identical to that for
apps/myapp/Makefile described above.</p>

<h4 id="makefile">Makefile</h4>
<p>Something that may be unexpected at
first is that you don’t need to provide any project-specific targets in
your top-level Makefile. Generally this file just needs to make
app-images the default target and include project.mk. It’s possible you
may want to override the default (by defining a target before including
project.mk) or provide some external targets of your own (after
including project.mk). You will most likely just want to mimic the
content of the file from the reference examples:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># app-images is provided in project.mk. 
</span><span class="nl">all</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">app-images</span>

<span class="k">include</span><span class="sx"> tools/common/project.mk</span>

<span class="c"># Extra project-specific targets. simulate-kzm: 
</span><span class="err">qemu-arm</span> <span class="err">-nographic</span> <span class="err">-M</span> <span class="err">kzm</span> <span class="err">-kernel</span> <span class="err">images/hello-image-arm-imx31</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="projectmk">project.mk</h4>
<p><strong>tools/common/project.mk</strong> contains
some generic targets and supporting infrastructure for building the
various components of your system. It is from this Makefile that the
application and library Makefiles are invoked. The architecture specific
elements of this are contained in <strong>tools/common/project-arm.mk</strong> and
<strong>tools/common/project-ia32.mk</strong>. Your top-level Makefile should
import tools/common/project.mk to take advantage of the build system
support.</p>

<h4 id="commonmk">common.mk</h4>
<p><strong>tools/common/common.mk</strong> is the
equivalent of tools/common/project.mk for the application-/library-level
compilation (as opposed to top-level). This probably won’t make much
sense unless you are familiar with the two-stage build process that is
being invoked when you type “make”, but you generally won’t need to
concern yourself with the inner workings of this file anyway. This file
contains a collection of generic compiler flags and targets shared
between all projects. It has evolved over time (in some instances in
response to bugs in toolchains), so it is possible there are sections of
this file that are deprecated. If you find something incorrect or
deprecated feel free to correct or modify it, but be aware that even
seemingly innocuous changes to this file are quite likely to break other
people’s builds.</p>

<h4 id="makefileflags">Makefile.flags</h4>
<p><strong>Makefile.flags</strong> and
<strong>tools/common/Makefile.flags</strong> contain a set of options that are
applied globally at the top level. These generally contain
compiler-specific options to discriminate between your target platforms.
The shared settings in tools/common/Makefile.flags should be more than
sufficient for most projects, but projects with more esoteric build
requirements may need to use Makefile.flags to override or extend the
shared settings. Most projects will have an empty Makefile.flags because
there is almost always a more appropriate place to put an override.</p>

<h1 id="build-execution">Build Execution</h1>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> ‘‘If you are accustomed to Kbuild from
the Linux kernel, note that we do not use Kbuild in the same way it is
used in Linux. In particular, components are built with their own
Makefiles, not with the Kbuild generic targets that build object files
at a directory-level granularity. It is best not to assume any behaviour
you may be familiar with from Kbuild.’’</p>

<p>Where Kconfig handles the configuration of your build process, the
remainder of the build system manages dependencies and rules within a
build. The tools/Kbuild directory itself is a black hole of despair and
I would encourage you not to look in there unless you have a high
tolerance for pain. All other relevant files are covered above.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Why do I need to specify the same
list of dependencies in apps/myapp/Makefile, apps/Kbuild and
apps/myapp/Kconfig?</strong></p>

<p>While these dependency lists appear to serve an identical function, they
actually do not. apps/myapp/Makefile defines the contents of LIBS to be
the libraries that your application is linked against. apps/Kbuild
defines the dependencies (libraries or otherwise) of your applications.
apps/myapp/Kconfig defines the dependency structure of Kconfig menu
items that may or may not map to build targets. In practice, most of our
use cases have an identical list for these three, but they have been
kept separate to allow a finer grained control over the build system
when necessary.</p>

<p>If this really is a serious irritation to you and your dependencies
really are the same in all three places, you can replace your dependency
line in apps/Kbuild with:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nl">myapp</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nf">$(shell grep "depends on" $(APPS_ROOT)/myapp/Kconfig | sed -e 's/depends on//g' -e 's/[&amp;_]//g' | tr A-Z a-z)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and your LIBS line in
apps/myapp/Makefile with:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">LIBS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>patsubst lib%,%,<span class="p">$(</span>shell <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="s2">"depends on"</span> <span class="p">$(</span>SOURCE_DIR<span class="p">)</span>/Kconfig | <span class="nb">sed</span> <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s1">'s/depends on//g'</span> <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s1">'s/[&amp;_]//g'</span> | <span class="nb">tr </span>A-Z a-z<span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will make apps/myapp/Kconfig the
canonical source of your dependency information.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Why do I need to pick which libraries get built when this is
determined by my application’s dependencies? Why does deslecting
libraries hide the applications that depend on them?</strong></p>

<p>This is related to the question above. These options exist in Kconfig so
you can build libraries in isolation from any applications that depend
on them. In general this is not something you want to do, but there are
cases where we do need this functionality available. When you deselect
an item in Kconfig it hides all the items that depend on that item. If
this is not the behaviour you want you should consider using a select
clause instead of a depends on clause.</p>

<p>Be aware that while select and depends on can express the same
dependency relationship that will correctly apply transitively, they do
not play well together. An automated selection caused by a select will
not take depends on clauses into account and automatic deselection
caused by depends on will not take select clauses into account. Used
exclusively however, either can be used in a given scenario. E.g. a
dependency of FOO on BAR, that depends on MOO can be expressed as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>config FOO
    bool "foo"
    depends on BAR

config BAR
    bool "bar"
    depends on MOO

config MOO
    bool "moo"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>config FOO 
    bool "foo"
    select BAR

config BAR
    bool "bar"
    select MOO

config MOO
    bool "moo"
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The difference will be in the behaviour in menuconfig, not in the
actual dependency inferred by Kconfig.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>How do I debug what the build system is doing?</strong></p>

<p>Use make V=2 or make V=3. Be aware that V=3 generates a lot of output.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>What is this $(call cc-option… business?</strong></p>

<p>cc-option is defined in tools/kbuild/Kbuild.include. It is used as
$(call cc-option, flags1, flags2). It passes flags1 to your compiler
($(CC), not $(HOST_CC)) and returns flags1 if they are accepted. If
your compiler returns an error it returns flags2. It is basically a way
of probing what flags your compiler supports.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>What is the difference between CFLAGS, HOSTCFLAGS and
NK_CFLAGS?</strong></p>

<p>There are two compilers in the build system, CC and HOSTCC. CC is the
compiler that is used to build your project, while HOSTCC is the
compiler that is used to build the tools that are used to build your
project. HOSTCC is typically your operating system’s native GCC, while
CC is often a cross-compiler. The contents of HOSTCFLAGS are used when
invoking HOSTCC, while the other two FLAGS variables are used with CC.
The contents of CFLAGS is used when compiling the kernel. NK_CFLAGS
applies to applications and libraries. The terminology stems from Linux,
where there are kernel flags and Non-Kernel flags. To avoid confusion,
the build system treats CFLAGS and NK_CFLAGS identically in your
application/library Makefiles and you can modify either for the same
effect.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>How do I dump the contents of Makefile variables? How do I
determine what context my rules are executed in?</strong></p>

<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">$(</span><span class="nb">foreach</span> var,<span class="p">$(</span>.VARIABLES<span class="p">)</span>,<span class="p">$(</span>warning <span class="p">$(</span>var<span class="p">)</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">$($(</span>var<span class="p">))))</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />
<p><strong>Why do some projects’ libs/Kbuild use a sel4libs-y variable?</strong></p>

<p>This is hangover from a previous abstraction for portability. This extra
level of indirection serves no purpose in the current build system. If
you encounter a libs/Kbuild that looks like the following:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">sel4libs-$(CONFIG_LIB_FOO)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> libfoo
<span class="nv">sel4libs-$(CONFIG_LIB_BAR)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> libbar
<span class="err">...</span>

<span class="nv">libs-y</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="p">$(</span>sel4libs-y<span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="err">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>please update it to remove sel4libs-y:</p>
<div class="language-make highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">libs-$(CONFIG_LIB_FOO)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> libfoo
<span class="nv">libs-$(CONFIG_LIB_BAR)</span> <span class="o">+=</span> libbar
<span class="err">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>What does it mean when I get errors like make[1]: *** No rule
to make target ‘-lfoo’, needed by `bar’. Stop.? Why is “-lfoo” a
target?</strong></p>

<p>Library targets are automatically generated by the build system. This
error usually indicates that your apps/Kbuild or libs/Kbuild does not
correctly describe the dependencies for one of your targets.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Why is the documentation for Kbuild and Kconfig so poor?</strong></p>

<p>Kbuild and Kconfig exist in the Linux kernel source tree. Attempts have
been made to separate them out and make them independent, but nothing
particularly successful has come from this. As a result the only
reliable and current source of documentation for both is in the Linux
kernel, where maintainers tend to have an attitude of “the source is the
documentation.” Most of the time the best way to determine
Kbuild/Kconfig behaviour is to try something and see what happens.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Why does the build system silently ignore typos in variable
names?</strong></p>

<p>This is partly related to their origins from Kbuild and Kconfig and
partly a limitation of GNU Make. In many instances variables are
expanded in such a way that the system is provided with no feedback as
to whether the variable was undefined or whether it was set to nothing.
Either way, there’s not much to be done here other than pair program
your Makefiles.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Why do some items in menuconfig get indented for no apparent
reason? E.g. Twinkle library for seL4.</strong></p>

<p>I have no idea. As near as I can tell it has something to do with the
starting character, but if you manage to get to the bottom of this
please fix.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>When trying to compile libsel4muslcsys, why do I get errors like
fatal error: stdio.h: No such file or directory?</strong></p>

<p>You likely have a configuration line in your libs/Kbuild that causes one
of libmuslc or libsel4muslcsys to depend on the other. In this file
neither should depend on the other.</p>

<p>There is a circular dependency between libmuslc and libsel4muslcsys.
This is known and intentional; libsel4muslcsys provides the backend seL4
support for libmuslc’s functionality. This dependency should not be
expressed in the build system or you will experience compilation errors
like the above. When the build system is configured such that neither
library depends on each other, it will correctly stage the libc headers
that libsel4muslcsys is expecting to find and correctly link the symbol
references in libmuslc to the provided symbols in libsel4muslcsys.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>I’m trying to do something unusual that is not natively supported
by the build system, so I added my own rules to apps/my_app/Makefile.
Now nothing seems to get built. What’s going on?</strong></p>

<p>Adding custom rules is fine, but they need to come after the line where
you include common.mk</p>

<p>An app’s Makefile is invoked with no explicit target (make), so the
first target encountered is built. This is intended to be default,
supplied by common.mk, but if you introduce a rule before including this
file, your target supersedes default. As a side note, it is possibly
worth modifying the parent Makefile to directly call make default to
remove this gotcha.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Kbuild and Kconfig are GPL-ed. Does this mean the code I build with them is automatically GPL-ed?</strong></p>

<p>No. This is a well-established issue, which has been dealt with in other
projects before. Using a GPL-ed build system or linking against GPL-ed
libraries does not force your project to be GPL-ed.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>This build system is terrible. Why aren’t we using &lt;insert some other build system&gt;?</strong></p>

<p>All build systems suck. The only thing worse than your current build
system is your future build system. Life goes on.&lt;/flamebait&gt;</p>

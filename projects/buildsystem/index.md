# System configuration and building

seL4 and related projects use the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) family of tools to implement its build system.
The seL4 build system refers to a collection of CMake scripts that manage:
- system configuration: Configuration options such as platform flags and application settings.
- dependency structures: Tracking build order dependencies
- builds: Generating binary artifacts that can then be deployed on hardware.


The following documentation covers how to use the seL4 build system to:
- perform system configuration and builds
- incorporating the build system into a project
- Kernel stand-alone configuration and builds

## CMake basics

For a complete guide to CMake you can read the [extensive documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/),
but for the purposes here we will assume a particular workflow with CMake involving out of tree builds.

CMake is not itself a build tool, but rather is a build generator. This means that it generates build scripts,
typically Makefiles or Ninja scripts, which will be used either by a tool like GNU Make or Ninja to perform
the actual build.

### Pre-requisites

It is assumed that

 * CMake of an appropriate version is installed
 * You are using the Ninja CMake generator
 * You understand how to checkout projects using the repo tool as described on the
   [Resources](/Resources) page
 * You have the [required dependencies](/HostDependencies) installed to build your project.

## Gotchas

List of gotchas and easy mistakes that can be made when using cmake

 * Configuration files passed to to cmake with `-C` *must* end in `.cmake`, otherwise CMake will silently throw
   away your file

## Old build system

We used to use a Kbuild based build system. Old documentation for it can be found [here](/Developing/Building/OldBuildSystem/).

# Verified Configurations

This page describes which architecture/platform/configuration
combinations of seL4 have verified properties, which configurations
possess which properties, and how to obtain an seL4 version for a
specified configuration.

At this time, verification of seL4 remains a more time-intensive process
than software development. Consequently, while seL4 has been ported to
multiple architectures, and its build system allows further
configuration of internal and hardware features, verified configurations
are necessarily both less numerous and more specific.

These configurations are also referred to as *verification platforms*,
currently constituting: ARM, ARM\_HYP, ARM\_MCS, AARCH64, RISCV64, RISCV64\_MCS, X64

Please consult [Frequently Asked
Questions](/FrequentlyAskedQuestions), as well as the [proof and
assumptions page](http://sel4.systems/Info/FAQ/proof.pml) for a better
understanding of the intersection of verification and seL4.

## Examining and Building Verified Configurations

Current verified configurations can be found in seL4 sources in the
`configs` folder:
```sh
ls configs/*_verified.cmake
# AARCH64_verified.cmake         ARM_verified.cmake
# ARM_HYP_exynos5_verified.cmake RISCV64_MCS_verified.cmake
# ARM_HYP_verified.cmake         RISCV64_verified.cmake
# ARM_MCS_verified.cmake         X64_verified.cmake
# ARM_imx8mm_verified.cmake
```

To obtain specific source code and build for a given configuration (e.g.
ARM) in a build directory:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -P ../config/ARM_verified.cmake
```

Notably ``kernel.elf`` is the kernel binary, and ``kernel_all_pp.c`` is
the kernel source code after preprocessing, which is used as the basis
for verification efforts.

Also see [Stand-alone seL4 builds](/Developing/Building/seL4Standalone)
for general guidelines on generating an seL4 binary from an existing
configuration and what to do with a ``kernel.elf`` file.

## Available Verified Configurations

### Unverified Features

At present, none of our verified configurations take into account
address translation for devices (System MMU or IOMMU), debug/profiling
interfaces, or the kernel startup at boot.

The proofs for RISCV64\_MCS/ARM\_MCS (mixed-criticality extensions to real-time
seL4 features), as well as security proofs for AARCH64 are in progress. Refer to
the [roadmap](/projects/roadmap.html) for status and upcoming features.

# seL4 releases

This page documents tagged releases of the seL4 kernel and proofs, for documentation on the release
process we follow see [here](/ReleaseProcess).

## Landmark releases

This section documents the version at which specific features were introduced to seL4. For future
features, see [seL4 status](/Status). For other previous features, see the release notes below.

*Verification Status* carries the following definitions and refers to the version specified in the
[verification manifest](/ReleaseProcess#verified-manifests) tagged for that specific release.

* No: As of this release, this feature is not verified.
* FC: the functional correctness proofs are complete.
* FCI: the integrity proofs are complete, in addition to functional correctness.
* Yes: this feature has functional correctness, integrity and infoflow proofs completed, for verified platforms, as of this release.

For the verification status of all platforms, see [Hardware](/Hardware).

## Master (verified kernel)
{% assign coll = site['releases'] | where: "project", "sel4" %}
{% comment %}
Sort sorts by string sorting so a version of 2.3.0 is higher than 10.0.0.
Because of this we need to split the list into two before sorting.
{% endcomment %}
{% assign releases_1 = coll | where_exp:"item", "item.version_digits != 2" | sort: "version"  %}
{% assign releases_2 = coll | where_exp:"item", "item.version_digits == 2" | sort: "version" %}
{% assign releases =  releases_1 | concat: releases_2 %}

{% for release in releases  %}
    {% if release.variant != "mcs" %}

[{{ release.title }}]({{ release.url }})
([manual](http://sel4.systems/Info/Docs/seL4-manual-{{ release.version }}.pdf))

{% endfor %}

## Experimental Branches

We occasionally pre-release experimental branches for community feedback and availability.

### Mixed Criticality Support (MCS) / Realtime

As of seL4 version 11.0.0, this is now provided via the kernel configuration option `KernelIsMCS` in CAmkES which should be set to `ON` which switch the scheduler implementaiton and enable the MCS API.

{% for release in releases  %}
    {% if release.variant == "mcs" %}
[{{ release.title }}]({{ release.url }})
([manual](http://sel4.systems/Info/Docs/seL4-manual-{{ release.version }}.pdf))
    {% endif %}

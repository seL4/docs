# Using CAN on L4T through an MCP251X

## Before running L4TCAN: Jumper HW-based chipselect to the GPIO chipselect
Because L4T with CAN doesn't use GPIO chipselect (yet),
it's necessary to connect the hardware CSN line to the GPIO used for
chipselect.

Note that the GPIO dts sets the GPIO used for chipselect to high
impedance so bad things don't happen.

CSN is indicated on the SPI expansion header. Can node #1 on the CAN
daughterboard uses TK1_GPIO2, so it's necessary to connect these 2
pins:

<img style="width: 60%" src="jumper.jpg" alt="Jumper hw-based chipselect to GPIO chipselect" />

(From right-to-left on the TK1 GPIO header we have GPIO0, GPIO1, GPIO2)

NOTE: On the seL4 side, this may not be necessary as it will be able to
use GPIO-based chipselects.

NOTE2: Justification for GPIO chipselects is that we have 2 CAN nodes
and only 1 HW chipselect, so had to do it this way.

## Option 1. Use our Linux image
Grab the image at [tk1_can.img.gz] ([md5]). Make sure to verify against the
md5sum in the same folder once you've got it.

[md5]: https://trustworthy.systems/Downloads/tk1_can/checksum.txt
[tk1_can.img.gz]: https://trustworthy.systems/Downloads/tk1_can/tk1_can.img.gz

Set up the TK1 as usual - connect the UART as well as the recovery USB
port next to the ethernet jack. Stop u-boot from booting and issue the
command:

``` 
ums 0 mmc 0 
``` 
This will allow you to see the TK1's filesystem on
your host pc. On your host PC, list your devices:

``` 
$ lsblk 
```
You should see a 14.7GB-ish device with a few
partitions - this is the TK1. (Make sure it is by mounting the largest
partition and looking at the rootfs [making sure to unmount again
before next step!])

We're ready to image the TK1. Issue the following command, making
ABSOLUTELY sure that your of=/dev/sdX line is correct so you don't
accidentally destroy data on your machine. Also, you want /dev/sdX (the
device), NOT /dev/sdX3 (partitions) etc.
```
gunzip -c tk1_can.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/<your TK1 device> conv=sync bs=4K status=progress
```
This takes \~1.5Hr on my machine to
complete. If dd throws a strange error to do with the 'status=progress'
command, you may be using an old version of dd, it's fine to omit this
command however you will not see a progress bar.

Once this is complete, exit the ums command in u-boot and attempt to
boot. As long as the can board CS is jumpered to GPIO2, everything
should work.

You may see some lines after boot like:

``` 
rt5639 0-001c: Failed to set private addr: -121 
```

This is normal,
and everything should work regardless (internet connectivity works fine
on our system). We'll be looking into the reason for these errors in the
future.

See bottom of this page for 'hello-world'-type examples.

## Option 2: compile your own Linux
 The instructions from here on go
from a vanilla TK1-SOM L4T configuration to one which can support CAN
using the daughterboard.

Getting native Linux CAN drivers to work on the TK1-SOM requires a bit
of hackery, procedure outlined here.

Before going ahead with this, follow the TK1-SOM custom kernel
procedure, make sure you can build it and flash to the board

### Add device tree support for MCP251X to L4T & perform driver hacks
The kernel that is included in L4T does not support device tree
binding for the mcp251X, so you have to modify the kernel driver.

Easiest way to do that is to just use mine: (Works with latest L4T from
colorado. Don't use the upstream NVIDIA L4T)

Get it here: [mcp251x.c](mcp251x.c)

You want to replace the file in drivers/net/can/mcp251x.c

NOTE: this is NOT the same as the file in mainline kernel, it has a hack
that fixes a problem I had with the device tree not recognising clock
nodes.

This means that this file will only work with an MCP251X that has a
20MHz crystal!

I've also added a lot of debugging information to the driver so that
dmesg is a bit more helpful.

### Look at device tree documentation
 Device tree documentation does
not exist in the source code as mcp support has been hacked in. Here's
the docs from mainline:

  .
```

-   Microchip MCP251X stand-alone CAN controller device tree bindings

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be one of the following:
      -   "microchip,mcp2510" for MCP2510.
 
      - "microchip,mcp2515" for MCP2515.
- reg: SPI chip select.
- clocks: The clock feeding the CAN controller.
- interrupt-parent: The parent interrupt controller.
- interrupts: Should contain IRQ line for the CAN controller.

Optional properties:

- vdd-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN controller.
- xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver.

Example:

  can0: <can@1> {
 
      compatible = "microchip,mcp2515"; 
      reg = <1>; 
      clocks = <&clk24m>; 
      interrupt-parent = <&gpio4>; 
      interrupts = <13 0x2>; 
      vdd-supply = <&reg5v0>; 
      xceiver-supply = <&reg5v0>;
  };
```

### Modify the device tree
 Replace the existing .dts files with
[tegra124-tk1-som-pm375-000-c00-00.dts](tegra124-tk1-som-pm375-000-c00-00.dts)

You also need to remap some GPIOs, swap out the GPIO device tree with
[tegra124-tk1-som-gpio-default.dtsi](tegra124-tk1-som-gpio-default.dtsi)

### Kernel Build Configuration
 Using make menuconfig, enable CAN and
MCP251X modules. Make sure your .config contains:
```
CONFIG_CAN=m
CONFIG_CAN_RAW=m
CONFIG_CAN_BCM=m
CONFIG_CAN_GW=m
CONFIG_CAN_VCAN=m
CONFIG_CAN_DEV=m
CONFIG_CAN_CALC_BITTIMING=y
CONFIG_CAN_MCP251X=m
```
In addition to
the 'normal' tk1-som kernel build settings given by Colorado in their
readme.

It is up to you whether you would like to leave user-mode SPI drivers in
there or not, they simply won't load as the CAN dts removes the
user-space SPI device.

Once we figure out how to do GPIO-muxed chipselect on the TK1SOM
(working on it) it will be possible to use more than one CAN node &
user-space SPI at the same time.

### Enable hardware-based chipselect #0
 There is a strange old
touch-driver hanging around that needs to be disabled for you to be able
to use hardware CS on the TK1-SOM's SPI line.

Originally I pulled it out of the TK1-SOM's SPI driver, but it turns out
you can disable it in extlinux.conf, which is much simpler.

in /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf on your rootfs, find the touch_id=0@0
line, and change it to touch_id=3@3

### Load everything onto the board
 You could do something like this:

update_kernel.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

L4T_DIR=/home/seb/TK1_SOM_2GB_Flashing/Linux_for_Tegra
SOM_DIR=/mnt/TK1SOM

sudo cp $L4T_DIR/sources/kernel/arch/arm/boot/zImage
$SOM_DIR/boot/zImage sudo cp
$L4T_DIR/sources/kernel/arch/arm/boot/dts/tegra124-tk1-som-pm375-000-c00-00.dtb
$SOM_DIR/boot/tegra124-tk1-som-pm375-000-c00-00.dtb
```

rebuild.sh - assumes u-boot running `umc 0 mmc 0` at `<tk1>`
```
    make

    make modules

    mount /dev/<tk1> /mnt/TK1SOM

    ./update_kernel.sh

    make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/mnt/TK1SOM

    umount /dev/sdb1
```

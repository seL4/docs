# Odroid-C2

The Odroid-C2 is a single board computer based on the Amlogic S905
System-on-Chip.

<https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/odroid-c2>

Only 64-bit mode is supported both with and without SMP. Hypervisor
support has not been tested.

## U-Boot

The default U-Boot will allocate DMA regions that can corrupt seL4
kernel memory.
Mainline U-Boot can be used instead on this board.
Some Linux distributions include mainline U-Boot binaries compiled for
this board, or you can compile U-Boot yourself.

## Building seL4test

{% include sel4test.md %}

## Booting via TFTP

Make sure you've set up a TFTP server to serve the seL4 image.

```
dhcp
tftp 0x20000000 <YOUR_TFTP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>:sel4test-driver-image-arm-odroidc2
go 0x20000000
```

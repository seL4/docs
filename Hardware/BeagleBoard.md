# seL4 on the BeagleBoard


This page documents booting seL4 on the
[Beagleboard](http://beagleboard.org/beagleboard), Omap
3530

See [Tim Newsham's post](http://sel4.systems/pipermail/devel/2014-August/000030.html) on the mailing list for one user's experience.

## Preparing your SD card
### Prologue
These instructions are for
later versions of the Beagleboard. Before the Xm, U-Boot and MLO were
held in flash.

The first stage boot loader expects to find the TI X-loader in the root
of a FAT filesystem, on the first partition of the SD card with the name
MLO.

MLO expects to find a file named u-boot.bin in the root directory of the
SD card.

## Setting up Minicom
 Plug the board in. seL4 userspace currently
does no power management â€” you will probably need a 5V power source, and
not rely on powering the board over USB

If you do not have minicom installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install minicom
```

If you are connecting via a USB serial adapter:

```bash
sudo minicom -s ttyUSB0
```
And if you were connecting via a **real** serial port:

```bash
sudo minicom -s ttyS0
```

In either
case, this will take you to a configuration menu.

1.  Choose Serial Port Setup
2.  Set A: Serial Device to `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyS0` depending on
  which serial device you want to use.
3.  Set F: Hardware Flow Control to No
4.  Set speed to `115200` and eight bit no parity.
5.  Save setup as `ttyUSB0` or `ttyS0`
6.  Exit Minicom

You can now connect to the !BeagleBoard using Minicom:

```bash
minicom ttyUSB0
```

Or:

```bash
minicom ttyS0
```

### Permissions
If you get permissions errors you need to add yourself to the
appropriate group. Find out which group on your machine has access to
the serial ports (on Debian, it's usually dialout):
```bash
$ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 Aug 11 09:43 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Then add yourself to the right group:
```bash
sudo usermod -G dialout -a your_login_name
```

### U-Boot
Now minicom should connect to what
it thinks is a "modem", and then give you a good old console to work
with. You are now in the bootloader, U-Boot, of the \~BeagleBoard. You
can type commands here and it'll display the results.

Some quick useful commands: 

|Command|Description|
|-|-|
|help |display list of commands |
|printenv|lists defined environment variables |
|mmc init |initialise MMC (to read the the SD card) |
|mmcinfo |display current SD card info |
|fatls mmc 0 |display list of files on SD card 0 |
|fatload |load script/image into some RAM address to be run |
|run |run scripts |
|bootelf |boot into en ELF image |

## Running seL4test

{% include sel4test.md %}

Which after a few minutes should give you:

Now, the ELF image we
boot into is the `sel4test-driver-image-arm-omap3` file. 
Copy that file onto the sdcard (the boot loader will be able to load images into RAM from a FAT image: there is no need to do an image copy). If your SD card is not formatted, just format it using FAT32.
Plug the SD card back into the BeagleBoard and reset the board by pressing the `S2` (reset) button.

### To run the image:
``` 
mmc init
mmcinfo
fatload mmc 0 ${loadaddr} sel4test-driver-image-arm-omap3
bootelf ${loadaddr}
```
where loadaddr
is some address, in this example defined as an environment variable.

Note: by default, the image produced is relocated to run at address 0x82000000. If you want to change the address, you need to modify the file `projects/tools/elfloader-tool/gen_boot_image.sh` (look for the omap3 case). For the Beaglebone Black Rev A5, RAM is from address 0x80000000 - 0x9FFFFFFF. 

Depending on the uBoot version present on the Beaglebone, the `bootelf` command might not be present. You can use the `go` command instead. I.e.:
```
mmc init
mmcinfo
fatload mmc 0 0x82000000 sel4test-driver-image-arm-omap3
go 0x82000000
```

After this you should start seeing output from seL4test.

Tip: if you don't remember the name of the images on your SD card, you can use:
```
fatls mmc 0
```
to see what is on the SD card.

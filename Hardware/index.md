# Supported platforms

### Summary

seL4 is available on 3 major hardware architectures, [ARM](#arm),
[RISC-V](#risc-v) and [x86](#x86), for a number of platforms with varying
hardware features.

seL4 is formally verified for specific configurations for a subset of these
platforms. The depth of the proofs and which properties are verified depend on
the platform.

The tables below provide more details.


### Platforms' attributes

The tables below list the platforms for which seL4 is available. For each
platform, the tables list:

- whether specific features are supported (e.g. *Virtualisation*, *IOMMU/SMMU*, etc) and to which degree (where applicable);
- the *verification status* (see more [below](#verification-status));
- who has contributed this platform port;
- who is maintaining this platform port.

### Verification status

The seL4 proofs only hold for specific configurations, as noted in the *Verification Status* column in the tables, as follows:

* Unverified: this platform is not verified at all and is not scheduled for verification.
* Ongoing: this feature is currently undergoing verification.
* FC: the functional correctness proofs are complete.
* Verified: all proofs for this platform are complete, including functional correctness, integrity and information flow.

More information can be found on the [Verified Configurations](../projects/sel4/verified-configurations.md) page.

### Not in the lists below?

If the platform, architecture, feature that you are after is not listed on this page,
you have several options, listed below. It is important to note however that, as
explained in the guidelines linked below, contributing new ports or features will require
compelling arguments, discussion with the technical community (including through
Request-For-Comments), as well as testing requirements and maintenance/expertise
commitment, to a degree depending on the nature of the contribution.


* You can contact one of the seL4 Foundation [Endorsed Services
  Providers](https://sel4.systems/Foundation/Services/) to get commercial
  support or professional advice to develop such a port or feature (with the
  implications and expectations detailed in our [guidelines for contributing
  kernel code](../projects/sel4/kernel-contribution.html));

* You can check the [roadmap](../projects/roadmap.html) for any planned
  contributions, from the seL4 Foundation or larger community, such on any new
  architecture ports, new large formal verifications, or large or fundamental
  new features;

* You can contact the seL4 community through one of our [communication
  channels](https://sel4.systems/contact/) to ask whether someone is developing
  such a port or feature already, or whether there is general interest in discussing
  such a new port or feature;

* If you are in a position to develop the seL4 port or feature yourself, you
  should follow our [guidelines for contributing kernel
  code](../projects/sel4/kernel-contribution.html), which details the
  implications and expectations.


### Simulating seL4

Running seL4 in a simulator is a quick way to test it out and iteratively develop software.
Note that feature support is then limited by the simulator.
See [Running It](/seL4Test#RunningIt) for how to run seL4 using Qemu.

You can also [run seL4 on VMware](VMware).

## ARM

seL4 has support for select ARMv7 and ARMv8 Platforms.

## RISC-V

We currently provide support for some of the RISC-V platforms. Support for the hypervisor extension is yet to be mainlined.

##  <span style="color:grey">Unmaintained platforms</span>

<span style="color:grey">
Unmaintained platforms are platforms for which code has been contributed, but
this code is not or no longer tested and is unlikely to work. We list these
here, because bringing an unmaintained platform up may be faster and easier than
starting from scratch on a new platform port.

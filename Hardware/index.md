# Supported Platforms

### Summary

seL4 is available on 3 major hardware architectures, [ARM](#arm),
[RISC-V](#risc-v) and [x86](#x86), for a number of platforms with varying
hardware features.

seL4 is formally verified for specific configurations for a subset of these
platforms. The depth of the proofs and which properties are verified depend on
the platform.

The tables below provide more details.


### Platforms' attributes

The tables below list the platforms for which seL4 is available. For each
platform, the tables list:

- whether specific features are supported (e.g. *Virtualisation*, *IOMMU/SMMU*, etc) and to which degree (where applicable);
- the *verification status* (see more [below](#verification-status));
- who has contributed this platform port;
- who is maintaining this platform port.

### Verification status

The seL4 proofs only hold for specific configurations, as noted in the *Verification Status* column in the tables, as follows:

* Unverified: this platform is not verified at all and is not scheduled for verification.
* Ongoing: this feature is currently undergoing verification.
* FC: the functional correctness proofs are complete.
* Verified: all proofs for this platform are complete, including functional correctness, integrity and information flow.

More information can be found on the [Verified Configurations](../projects/sel4/verified-configurations.md) page.


### Simulating seL4

Running seL4 in a simulator is a quick way to test it out and iteratively develop software.
Note that feature support is then limited by the simulator.
See [Running It](/seL4Test#RunningIt) for how to run seL4 using Qemu.

You can also [run seL4 on VMware](VMware).


## ARM

seL4 has support for select ARMv7 and ARMv8 Platforms.

## RISC-V

We currently provide support for some of the RISC-V platforms. Support for the hypervisor extension is yet to be mainlined.

## x86

We support PC99-style Intel Architecture Platforms.

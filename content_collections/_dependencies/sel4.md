## seL4 Build Dependencies

To build seL4-based projects, ensure you have installed the dependencies described in the [Base Build Dependencies](#base-build-dependencies) and [Python Dependencies](#python-dependencies) sections below.

### Base Build Dependencies

To establish a usable development environment it is important to install your distributions basic build packages.

#### Ubuntu

These instructions are intended for Ubuntu LTS versions 20.04 and 22.04.

> As dependencies and packages may be frequently changed, deprecated or updated these instructions may become out of date. If you discover any missing dependencies and packages we welcome new [contributions](https://docs.sel4.systems/DocsContributing) to the page.

**Base dependencies**

The basic build package on Ubuntu is the `build-essential` package. To install run:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Additional base dependencies for building seL4 projects on Ubuntu include installing:

```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake ccache ninja-build cmake-curses-gui
sudo apt-get install libxml2-utils ncurses-dev
sudo apt-get install curl git doxygen device-tree-compiler
sudo apt-get install u-boot-tools
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip python-is-python3
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler python3-protobuf
```

**Simulating with QEMU**

In order to run seL4 projects on a simulator you will need QEMU:

```sh
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-arm qemu-system-x86 qemu-system-misc
```

**Cross-compiling for ARM targets**

To build for ARM targets you will need a cross compiler:

```sh
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi g++-arm-linux-gnueabi
sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

(you can install the hardware floating point versions as well if you wish)

```sh
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

**Cross-compiling for RISC-V targets**

To build for RISC-V targets you will need a cross compiler:

{% include risc-v.md %}

**Builidng the seL4 manual**

If you would like to build the seL4 manual, you will need the following LaTeX pacakges:

```sh
sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra
```

#### Debian

##### For Debian Bullseye or later

The dependencies listed in our Docker files [repository](https://github.com/seL4/seL4-CAmkES-L4v-dockerfiles) will work for a Debian installation. You can refer to this repository for an up-to-date list of base build dependencies. Specifically refer to the dependencies listed in the file here:

* [Base Tools](https://github.com/seL4/seL4-CAmkES-L4v-dockerfiles/blob/master/scripts/base_tools.sh)
* [seL4](https://github.com/seL4/seL4-CAmkES-L4v-dockerfiles/blob/master/scripts/sel4.sh)
* [LaTeX](https://github.com/seL4/seL4-CAmkES-L4v-dockerfiles/blob/master/scripts/apply-tex.sh)

### Python Dependencies

Regardless of your Linux distribution, python dependencies are required to build seL4, the manual and its proofs. To install you can run:

```sh
pip3 install --user setuptools
pip3 install --user sel4-deps
```

(Some distributions use `pip` for python3, others use `pip3`.  Use the Python 3 version for your distribution)

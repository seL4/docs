# capDL Version 0.3.0 Release

#### 2024-07-01

Announcing the release of `0.3.0`, using seL4 version 13.0.0.

### Changes

* add support for SMC capability
* add support for binding notifications to TCBs
* enable MCS build; use `seL4_TCB_SetAffinity` only for non-MCS kernels
* allow `SchedControlCap` to refer to a secondary core
* minimal update for seL4 AArch64 VSpace API change, removing `seL4_ARM_PageGlobalDirectoryObject`
* `object_sizes`: add include for deprecated constants, because some definitions
  that `object_sizes` depends on are now found in a `deprecated.h` header file.
* Clean up and clarify `arm11` usage in capDL despite ARMv6 removal
* `cdl_utils`: remove `simpleeval` python dependency
* Run GitHub tests with python 3.9
* added vulnerability reporting policy

#### capdl-loader

* use `seL4_BootInfoFrameSize` instead of hard-coded page size
* python + loader: Add support for generating fault handler caps with specific
  rights. Behaviour is unchanged (`seL4_AllRights`) if no rights are provided.
* ensure heap is aligned

#### capDL-tool

* update to LTS Haskell 20.25, ghc-9.2.8
* fix several cases in `validObjPars`: `Period`, `IOAPIC`, `MSIHandle`, `CBNumber`

### Upgrade Notes

* existing capDL specs should continue to work
* AArch64 VSpace changes may allow simplification of some capDL specs

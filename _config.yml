# Build/plugin settings.  These settings configure plugins.
# Themes and plugins transparently add files to the site project.  To see what plugins
# are being used run `bundle show`.  To see what files are contributed by each plugin:
#  ls `bundle show $plugin_name`
# The jekyll-theme-bootstrap dependency probably contributes the most files to site generation, so it would
# be the first place to look if something weird is happening with layout/theming.
# This theme provides a sass port of bootstrap that is imported using our assets/css/style.scss file.

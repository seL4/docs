    used instead. Software mitigation is done by disabling jump tables (the only form of
    indirect jump in seL4 except for 'ret') and flushing the RSB on vmexit. Flushing the RSB
    at other times is not needed as seL4 does not switch kernel stacks and so is not
    vulnerable to RSB underflow. The STIBP is essentially software mitigation but enables
    the single thread isolation for branch predictions. This is only needed if attempting
    to protect user level process from each other in a multicore environment."
